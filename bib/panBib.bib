title = {Speaking Code: Coding as Aesthetic and Political Expression},
year = {2012},
isbn = {0262018365},
publisher = {The MIT Press},
abstract = {Speaking Code begins by invoking the "Hello World" convention used by programmers when learning a new language, helping to establish the interplay of text and code that runs through the book. Interweaving the voice of critical writing from the humanities with the tradition of computing and software development, in Speaking Code Geoff Cox formulates an argument that aims to undermine the distinctions between criticism and practice and to emphasize the aesthetic and political implications of software studies. Not reducible to its functional aspects, program code mirrors the instability inherent in the relationship of speech to language; it is only interpretable in the context of its distribution and network of operations. Code is understood as both script and performance, Cox argues, and is in this sense like spoken language--always ready for action. Speaking Code examines the expressive and performative aspects of programming; alternatives to mainstream development, from performances of the live-coding scene to the organizational forms of peer production; the democratic promise of social media and their actual role in suppressing political expression; and the market's emptying out of possibilities for free expression in the public realm. Cox defends language against its invasion by economics, arguing that speech continues to underscore the human condition, however paradoxical this may seem in an era of pervasive computing.}

abstract = {Gamification broadly refers to technological, economic, cultural, and societal developments in which reality is becoming more gameful, and thus to a greater extent can afford the accruing of skills, motivational benefits, creativity, playfulness, engagement, and overall positive growth and happiness. These aspects are all commonly perceived as positive benefits of play and playing games. Gamification can be seen to progress through two primary developments: (1) Intentional gamification: where gamification is defined as an intentional process of transforming practically any activity, system, service, product, or organizational structure into one which affords similar positive experiences, skills, and practices as found in games. This is commonly but optionally done with an intention to facilitate changes in behaviors or cognitive processes. As the main inspirations of gamification are games and play, gamification is commonly pursued by employing game design. (2) Emergent gamification: where gamification can be defined as a gradual and emergent, albeit unintentional, cultural and societal transformation stemming from the increased pervasive engagement with games and gameful interactions. The assumption is that, through the increasingly pervasive role of games in human lives, our cultural and societal practices are gradually transforming into ones which are increasingly reminiscent of games, game communities, and player practices.}

abstract = {Summary The title of this essay by John Frazer refers to an article by Gordon Pask, ‘The Architectural Relevance of Cybernetics’, published in the AD issue Design Augmented by Computers in 1969. In the late 1960s, cybernetics, system theory and electronic computers were seen primarily as tools to facilitate the logic of problem solving and decision making in architectural design. The parallel world of cyberspace, created and sustained by the world's computers and communication lines is just one manifestation of deep cultural and technical changes which are reshaping our understanding of our world. The term cyberspace describes the invisible spatial interconnection of computers on the Internet and it is also applied to almost any virtual spatial experience created in a computer. Frazer's experiments may have been the first to explore the design potentials of the morphogenetic metaphor, a powerful and pervasive source of inspiration for digital designers to this day.}
